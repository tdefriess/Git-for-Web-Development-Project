    1. What is Semantic HTML?
Semantic HTML is markup that provides meaning for both people looking at your code, and for search engines. For instance, the <article> tag lets search engines know they can post the <article> to show a preview of content on a page that will make sense in that context.

    2. What is HTML used for?
HTML is a markup language that gives instructions to a web browser that describe how to interpret and organize information on a web page.

    3. What is an attribute and where do we put it?  An attribute is a property of a tag that is placed within the opening tag that provides additional information like a link to another document or page, a description or an alternate text for machine-readers. For instance, the src attribute gives the location of an image for an <img> tag, and the web developer may add an alt attribute to describe the image.

    4. What is the h1 tag used for? How many times should I use it on a page?

Metadata for a web page, like the page title, links to CSS and JS files, and the character code used for the page.
    7. What is an id? 
An id is an attribute added to a tag that provides a hook for CSS and intra-page navigation. Unique IDs are used only once per page. For instance, an about section on a home page may have the id "about" which a navigation link could point to using #about allowing a user to quickly find that section.
    8. What elements can I add an id to? 
I'm not sure there is a technical limitation i.e. you could add an id to any content element, but the best practice is to reserve IDs for specific sections a page.
    9. How many times can I use the same id on a page? 
Only once per unique id.
    10. What is a class? 
A class is a reusable descriptor and css hook to style multiple elements in the same manner.
    11. What elements can I add a class to?

IDs are referenced using the #. For instance, #about in a intra-page link or as a CSS hook.
    16. What is the difference between a section and a div
Section provides semantic meaning, letting a dev know that the content is its own section on a page. Divs are containers that provide no semantic meaning, but can group content together for styling purposes.

    19. What is the difference between a class and an id? - Give me an example of when I might use each one
Classes are used to style multiple elements on a page, whereas an ID is better used for only one element per unique ID, usually for web page sections. You might use a class names "image-aside" to style multiple images so they are displayed alongside their accompanying paragraphs and all use the same style without needlessly reusing code. You might use an id named "about" to point to an about section on a page.
    20. How do we select classes in CSS?
Classes are selected by using an period and then their name like so:
.image-aside {...}
    21. How do we select a p element with a single class of “human””?
p.human {...}
    22. What is a parent child selector? When would this be useful?

    23. How do you select all links within a div with the class of sidebar?
.sidebar a {...}

The line-height property.

Version control is used to govern changes to a project and keep it organized so that it is easier to return to a previous working state if necessary.

Stretch Questions

    1. What is the difference between an inline element and a block element?
An inline element is an element that is added without breaking a line within another element, for instance <em></em> to give a particular word or phrase emphasis within a paragraph. Block elements stack one on top of another with a line break between each by default, like <p> or a <h1>.
    2. What happens when an element is positioned absolutely? 
When an element is positioned absolutely it is positioned relative to the total area of a page, like 300 pixels right and 200 pixels down from the top left corner of a page.
    3. How do I make an element take up only the amount of space it needs but also have the ability to give it a width? 
I believe you would add a float property to the element.
    4. Name 3 elements that are diplay block by default, 2 elements that are display inline by default and 1 element that is display inline-block by default
Block: <p>, <h1>, <div>
Inline: <span>, <a>
Inline-block: <textarea>
    5. In your own words, explain the box model. What is the fix for the box model? 
The box model is the model that all html elements are built with. The content box is the space taken by the content within an element. The padding is the space immediately around the content. The border, which is optional, surrounds the padding area. Finally, the margin is the area surrounding the border, or the padding if there is no border. In order to get the total display size of an element you must add all together from top to bottom or left to right. I.e. margin-top + border-top + padding-top + content height + padding-bottom + border-bottom + margin-bottom for the total height of an element.
